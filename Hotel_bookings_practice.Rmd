## Import the data 

```{r loading data}
hotel_bookings <- read.csv("hotel_bookings.csv")
```

## Plotting relationship between lead_time = x and children = y. Hypothesis being that people with children book in advance. 



```{r creating scatter plot}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = lead_time, y = children))
```

## Weekend bookings data - find out which guests book most often on weekends in order to target that demographic for a new marketing campaign. It is suggested that guests without children book the most weekend nights. Is this true?

```{r creating scatter plot}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = stays_in_weekend_nights, y = children))
```
